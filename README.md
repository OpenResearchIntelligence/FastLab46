# FastLab46
A digital forensics suite to perform information quality checks on digital experimental resources in laboratories.

### FastLab46
Fastlab46 contains modules to screen your computer and a frontend (flask) to manage experiment.

### Cases
A library of examples

### Run locally
The current version of FastLab46 is meant to run on individual machines (laptops, workstations).

In the near future, a "lab edition" with integrated features to investigate experimental data at
the lab level will be implemented.
